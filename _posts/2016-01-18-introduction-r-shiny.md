Shiny is a web framework for R developers. Shiny allows users to develop websites that help present their analyses to users by allowing the analyses to be interactive through a web-based interfaces. Shiny web-interfaces are programmed in R without the need to develop anything in HTML, CSS, or Javascript, although Shiny is flexible enough to incorporate custom HTML, CSS, or Javascript if the user desires (to develop customized visualizations for instance). Most components of modern websites are available directly from Shiny. The presentation covers the basics of using Shiny while providing information on R packages that can help enhance Shiny websites with additional interactive features, such as interactive plots with tooltips.
