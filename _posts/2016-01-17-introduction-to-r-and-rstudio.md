R is a powerful language and environment for statistics and scientific graphics. Some of the main advantages of R is that is free/open-source and users can find a lot of help online. RStudio provides free interface to R that has an organized layout and many extra options for R users. The slides below give an overview to the R language, and they provide instructions on downloading and installing R and RStudio, as well as, showing some of the main features of RStudio.

Included in these slides are links to YouTube videos, which [cover R and RStudio installation most operating systems](https://www.youtube.com/user/canninl), including: Windows, Mac OSX, and Ubuntu Linux. Furthermore, the videos cover how to install and configure Java for R so that users can make use of the rJava package, which is used by many R packages; rJava allows package developers to make use of existing software written in Java that can oftentimes be faster than code written in R. Proper installation of rJava requires the [manual installation of the 64-bit version Java](http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). By default, the [main Java download page](http://www.java.com/en/download/) gives users a 32-bit version of Java that will not work.

After installing R, beginner users should read this [Introduction to R](http://blog.lunean.com/2016/01/18/introduction-to-r/).
